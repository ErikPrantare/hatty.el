* TODO Handle org links
Currently, the visible portion does not get hatted.  Investigate why
this is (bounds-of-thing-at-point for symbol).

* TODO Figure out how to handle space above continuation lines
I could simply avoid adding extra space in the svg for these cases.

* TODO Shortdoc

* TODO handle large raise display properties

* TODO Handle italicized text

* TODO Handle selection of bold text

* TODO Fix some issues in ascent
Should be visible in the TODO face of this header.

* TODO automatic modus compatibility?
Alternatively, provide a function for it.

* TODO Better default colors.

* TODO Specify default hat style explicitly

* Testing
** TODO Deduplicate text- and overlay property tests
** TODO Visualize before/after applying hats
** TODO Create visual manual tests
For manually inspecting rendering issues not easily testable in an
automatic fashion.  Show visual before/after, as in the previous TODO.
** TODO Cask for testing on different emacs versions
However, cask does not seem to be packaged for guix.
