* TODO Figure out how to handle space above continuation lines
I could simply avoid adding extra space in the svg for these cases.

* TODO Shortdoc

* TODO Handle large raise display properties

* TODO Handle italicized text

* TODO Handle selection of bold text

* TODO Fix some issues in ascent
Should be visible in the TODO face of this header.

* Testing
** TODO Deduplicate text- and overlay property tests
** TODO Think about removing reliance on hatty-reallocate
This function is only available when hatty-mode is active.
Alternatively, I could just check if the mode is active in the timers
instead of this function.
** TODO Create visual manual tests
For manually inspecting rendering issues not easily testable in an
automatic fashion.  Show visual before/after, as in the previous TODO.
** TODO Cask for testing on different emacs versions
However, cask does not seem to be packaged for guix.
